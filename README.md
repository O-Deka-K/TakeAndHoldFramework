# Take & Hold Framework
A successor to DevynDaMonster's [TNH Tweaker](https://thunderstore.io/c/h3vr/p/devyndamonster/TakeAndHoldTweaker/), TNH Framework aims to act as a base for anyone who wants to implement custom content for [Hot Dogs, Horseshoes & Hand Grenades](https://store.steampowered.com/app/450540/Hot_Dogs_Horseshoes__Hand_Grenades/)'s Take & Hold gamemode.

## Note
This is an Early Test Release version. While completely functional, and maintaining most of the functionality of the original TNH Tweaker, it's lacking in features intended for the mod's official, full release. The ETR versions serve as a beta/stopgap for fixing & improving TNH Tweaker.

## What is this?
This is a successor to TNH Tweaker. It originally started as an update to it, making it compatible with Institution and whatnot. It still is largely based upon TNH Tweaker, and I would like to massively thank Devyn for his work on it. I would've simply pushed this out as TNH Tweaker (updated) or whatever, but I have grander ambitions for the future that would ideally do with a rebrand, and for compatibility's sake, it's best if I rebrand now. 

As Devyn is no longer working on H3VR mods, this is will be the most up-to-date version.

## I still have Take & Hold Tweaker installed, what should I do?
Short version: Leave it installed. TNH Framework will handle everything for you.
Long version:
TNH Framework has a patcher included that will modify TNH Tweaker's files. If you want to disable TNH Framework and just run TNH Tweaker, you should disable TNH Framework, and then disable TNH Tweaker and re-enable it again.

## Features
As of right now, this mod does the following:
- Adds support for custom characters using YAML, with legacy support for TNH Tweaker/Deli-based custom characters.
- Optional replacement for Magazine Patcher. No longer will you have crashes due to using too much RAM while loading.
- Full Institution support.
- TNH Tweaker bugfixes.
- Vanilla game bugfixes.

## Installation
Install via the [r2modman](https://thunderstore.io/c/h3vr/p/ebkr/r2modman/) mod manager.

## Character Creation
[This guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1j92RENR0DX1t_81b4gsZzou_FpKNPUTj9CVgfmesqe0/edit?usp=sharing) should cover creating a custom character. Though hopefully this repository will have creating custom character information.
